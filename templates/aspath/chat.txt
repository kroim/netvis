am i clear?



1) instead of blank screen it should show the table and pull the time from clock1 and 2 .json
and just list the commands below


ssh
i need maaping_ssh.json so it maches hostname and redirect to some website.

info
populate json as table 

config and log just display the textfile. it works now but need to assigne to the id of button.

ok?
yesand system resources?

they are all static


only clock1 and clock 2 needs to come from json.
rest all just define it on the code. so i can edit manually

Good.
:)
1) is clear now.

please go ahead with 2)


remember you did this.


just like that i need an external maaping_ssh.json
so this file is DFW1-DCC-BSW01

so it should use a link from json like www.google.com as defined on that json.
when i click SSH button also tooltip.

Ok, I see.

please go to the next one.

same as 1.
all the info is on json's
for feature i only want enabled ones
just like how i showed in picture.

all info is identified by hostname, right?
what you mean?
I mean if we have a hostname, we can get all info to show.

so all this commands we are doing is all about that host device.
we are visualizing that device properties.
Ok, good

what types of showing do you want for config and log?
what are my options

i just want to display .txt so i can read.
when i click button.

But now the buttons and text are showed in same position
ya that is the problem :)
i got it wrong also i need that to display when i click the button.

i am just showing how the text should be displayed.

Ok, I have understood what you are looking for.
Almost of them is clear.
I think that it is better to check them after finishing initial work.
So you can ask me your requirements for them, and I will adjust them for you.

good.

now the price.
consider me as i am having more work and old client.
:)



but for now yes. i will send files in skype.

Ok.

Let me know your price.
i can pay 30 for this.
i think that is good price i am paying.


Here are my opinion.

each problems  are not so difficult.
But collecting them into one comprehensively is not so easy.

Let's see one by one.
Initial table; 10
SSH: 10
infor table: 20, it seems more difficult than others
config and log: 10
reorganizing : 10(in fact, this is most important and difficult)


reorganizing ??
yes, I mean optimize the structure of each functions of buttons.

ohh


So I think the total value is 50 at least.

How about ?
i am already speding a lot on this.

can i pay you 40

Well, sorry, now I have to go out.
I will be back 1 hour later.
Is it OK?

if we agree on price. i will send files and sleep
Ok, I agree although it seems a bit low.


i have more work and i will pay you 

Ok

i am doing this to learn and from my interest



what you need to send?index .json'same
All of L3 directory and this txt file we discussed.
ok

THanks
